7=Creed: Arum etal, arum etal,
11=Creed: Lo eth Solael, lo eth Bysmiel,
16=Creed: Monem Ulgrim thon Ocollo ut Oklaine!
22=Creed: Attak Seru!
34=Creed: This is too dangerous. I need to find another way...
38=Guard: The riftgate - something's coming through!
42=Bourbon: Inquisitor Creed! Devil's Crossing was attacked!
46=Creed: Take it easy, John. What's happened?
48=Bourbon: Some new kind of Aetherial - just smashed right through our defenses!
53=Bourbon: We need reinforcements! We're in bad shape.
56=Creed: Hm. I'll send help, but I can't spare much.
59=Creed: We're equally pressed here...
61=Creed: ...the loss of Ulgrim to the void may be more serious than you realize.
65=Bourbon: Ulgrim is dead, Creed. You must know that.
69=Bourbon: My people need help now! We won't survive another attack.
72=Creed: John, I -
73=Amala: It came from Malmouth...
76=Amala: ...that thing that attacked Devil's Crossing.
80=Amala: I escaped the city with a small group two weeks ago.
83=Amala: Most died crossing the burning fields.
85=Amala: My father was pulled into the bog by cannibals, I had to leave him.
90=Amala: I was the only one to make it to Devil's Crossing.
94=Amala: Malmouth has been a living nightmare since the Grim Dawn.
98=Amala: I was part of the Resistance there, if you can call it that.
102=Amala: The Aetherials toyed with us. As if we ever had a chance!
107=Amala: They let us fight on because they needed us. 
109=Amala: Needed our bodies for the grotesque things they make, deep beneath the city.
113=Amala: You think you're safe here, behind your stone walls,
117=Amala: but those things from Malmouth will keep coming, and they will find you...
122=Amala: ..and no fortress will ever be able to save you.
125=Creed: A chilling tale, indeed.
128=Creed: In our fight against the Chthonians,
130=Creed: We've overlooked the growing Aetherial threat.
133=Creed: We must find Ulgrim...
136=Creed: ...but maybe we can aid Malmouth at the same time.
140=Creed: You've already done a great deal,
142=Creed: But we must ask for your help once again.
145=Creed: We need you to strike at the heart of the Aetherial invasion...
148=Creed: ...far to the East,
150=Creed: In the ruined city of Malmouth.
