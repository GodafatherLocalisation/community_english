12=Bourbon: We paid a heavy price. But the trap worked?
15=Sahdina: You seem surprised.
17=Bourbon: It's been a while since we've had a win. How long will it hold?
21=Sahdina: I've never entrapped a being like this, but the bonds hold... for now.
26=Bourbon: How do we dispose of it?
28=Sahdina: I'm just a witch. You're the soldier.
32=Jarvis: If it bleeds, I can kill it.
35=Bourbon: How do you kill a spirit, though?
38=Sahdina: If you kill the mortal vessel while it's bound, the spirit may perish within. If it escapes...
45=Jarvis: It's listening to us!
49=Bourbon: What are you?
52=Possessed Figure: Others of your kind name us "Aetherial."
56=Bourbon: Why have you invaded our world?
58=Possessed Figure: Your world? We existed first, but were banished by your corrupt gods.
65=Your kind opened the way, and now we return to reclaim what by right should be ours!
72=Jarvis: I've heard enough of this rubbish, let's hang it.
85=Possessed Figure: Destroy this vessel and I will find another.
89=I have tasted its desires and emotions...
92=Your kind is weak. You have already lost this war.
98=Bourbon: Do it!
107=Sahdina: Captain!              Bourbon: Cut 'em down!
109=Jarvis: What, are you mad?! Better safe than sorry!
112=Sahdina: The spirit has fled!
114=Bourbon: This is a human now.
126=Sahdina: The captain is correct. When they awaken, they won't remember a thing.
133=Bourbon: The Aetherial was right - the war is lost.
137=We're a resistance now, and we need every human survivor we can call to our cause.
143=Maybe this one here can still die with some honor. If they ever wake up, send them to me.
150=If they don't, bury 'em deep with the others.
